## Fraud Analytics
This is an assignment submitted in an HKU fintech master course FITE7410 - Financial fraud analytics taught by Dr. Vivien CHAN.  
The course focuses on applying machine learning techniques in financial fraud detection.  
The posted assignments are the coding assignments in the course, all written in R.  
  
The first assignment is about exploratory data analysis (EDA) and applying K-means clustering on Credit Card Fraud Detection Data. One of the difficulties in fraud dectection is the highly unbalanced classes (because most of the transactions are assumed to be genuine), so class balancing algorithms such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and ROSE (Random Over-Sampling Examples) were applied to handle the data before modeling.  
  
The second assigment is about car insurance claim fraud detection, in which I used simple algorithms XGBoost and k-nearest neighbors (KNN) to complete the task.
